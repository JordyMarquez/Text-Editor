# Text Editor Starter Code

## Description

This is a simple text editor that demonstrate the functionality of PWAs using webpack and service workers. PWAs are great as they function even offline and can also be installed! The app has been deployed using heroku but the next section goes over how to use the code if you're interested 

## Usage

After cloinging the code, the client should run `npm i` in the terminal to install package.json. Then run `npm build` to create a dist folder in the client folder, and `npm start` to seed the app run on local host.
